# IG Bot

## Installation
Enter these terminal commands to install all dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FastestMolasses/IG-Bot.git
cd IGBot
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now create a file called `config.py` and fill with these values:
```python
INSTAGRAM_USERNAME = ''
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD = ''
TAGS=[]
COMMENTS=[]
```
Enter your Instagram username and password in their respective places. After that, fill the `TAGS` and `COMMENTS` variable with a list of values. `TAGS` will be used to search for users to follow and posts to like. `COMMENTS` is a list where a random value will be picked to leave a comment under a post.

## Usage
Use this bot in order to grow your Instagram following. This bot will do all the tedious tasks required to keep an Instagram page "healthy", which in turn will help your content rank higher in searches and in hash tag follows.
